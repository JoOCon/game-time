      Leapin' Frogger! Home may look like it's only a hop, skip, and a jump away, but looks can be deceiving. First, there's a
      dangerous highway to hop cross, full of fast-moving cars and trucks. Then there's a swirling river to leap, full of
      logs to float on or water to drown in. How's Frogger going to get home safely? By using your arrow keys to move Frogger
      up 👆🏼 down 👇🏼 left 👈🏼 and right 👉🏼. Guide Frogger safely through this perilous journey, and you'll jump for
      joy!
